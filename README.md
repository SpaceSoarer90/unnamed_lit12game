# LIT12 Literary Adaptation
  - this is the repo for the working files for rpgmaker mz.
  - all members of the technical committee must branch from the "main branch", which contains the assets that would be used throughout the entire game
  - when assets are updated, all members must push their commits to their respective branches
  - each member must work on one map at a time, they must never work on the same thing at a time.
